Tool to count tempi in Diplomacy.

Tempo is an important concept in chess, and we borrow it for
Diplomacy: One tempo is defined to be the movement of one piece from
one province to another.

Tempi measure the development of powers on the board more clearly than
supply centre count alone.  See the list of articles at
http://diplom.org/Zine/list.html#Caissa and especially
http://diplom.org/Zine/F1999R/Windsor/dipmap.html for details.  Or
